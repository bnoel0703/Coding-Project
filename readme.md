# Coding Project

## Criteria:
1) Loop over the JSON array below and display each item in the grocery list on your web page.
2) Each item in the JSON has a category property (fruit, dairy, etc.) that correlates to an SVG for
that category. Use the below links to use an SVG from the Noun project to be displayed for each
category.
* a. Fruit: https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=fruit&i=1262873
* b. Dairy: https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=dairy&i=1176637
* c. Beverage: https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=beverage&i=1284316
* d. Pasta: https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=pasta&i=1394541
* e. Dessert: https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=dessert&i=1128875
>Note on SVG icons: All SVG’s on the Noun project are free for non-commercial use. If you find
any of the SVG’s require payment please instead select a free choice to use as a substitute.
3) Keep web accessibility in mind, and try to avoid anything that would hinder accessibility (think:
screen readers)
4) Add code comments as you would if this project was a part of a larger team effort. Feel free to
use code comments to explain your thought process behind any coding decisions.
5) Use Sass or Less as a CSS preprocessor.
6) Feel free to use jQuery, Handlebars, or any JS library or framework if desired (but it is certainly
not part of the requirements )
7) Create a visually aesthetic page demonstrating both UI and UX principles
* a. Pick a font from https://fonts.google.com to use
* b. The visual design and personality is completely up to you
Good Luck and Have Fun!
